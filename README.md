# Objectives

- A calculator operation will consist of a number, an operator, and another number.
  - For example, 3 + 5:
  - Create three variables, one for each part of the operation. Youâ€™ll use these variables to update your display later.
- Create a new function 'operate' that takes an operator and two numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.
- Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit and operator (including =).
